The firmware that comes pre-installed on the Lego Mindstorms
NXT is somewhat limited and so Calum and myself
researched which programming languages could be used instead.
We eventually decided that leJOS1 would be a good
choice. Previous years had used leJOS for their projects, there
were multiple leJOS tutorials found online with relative ease
and, taking into consideration the skill set of our group, Java
was a popular choice.
With leJOS simply installing a Java virtual machine, it
allows the robot to be programmed using Java. Installing leJOS
was hassle free, and it didn’t take us long to compile, transfer
and execute our own programs.
