\section{Introduction}

	
\section{GUI}
A critical part of being able to test our robot has been the ability to select different options easily on the GUI. Figure \ref{fig:GUI} shows all the different choices that we can choose from:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Goal}: Choose the goal that we are aiming at.
 \item \textit{Our Robot}: Determines if our robot is mounted with the blue or yellow plate.
 \item \textit{Processor}: Get the location information from either a file, a process (i.e. our vision system) or a simulator.
 \item \textit{Strategy}: A list of strategies including goToBall and takePenalty.
 \item \textit{Executor}: Exectue the commands on the simulator or through Bluetooth.
\end{itemize}
Most of the GUI was implemented by Joe however, I realised, after testing the robot that we would need the ability to choose which goal is ours, and which is our opponents. This led to some flaws in our strategies that had assumed a single goal position, but were quickly updated.

\section{Sensors}
One of the construction team's iterations included a light sensor placed behind the kicker. I decided to try and use the sensor within the code on the brick.
