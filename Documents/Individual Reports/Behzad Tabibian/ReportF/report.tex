% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{./images/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
\usepackage{wrapfig} 
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
\vspace{-1 mm}
In this paper I will cover most of my achievements in System Design Project. One of my goals in this project was to build a solution based on research efforts in the field of robotic. Having this goal in mind, my main focus was on perception layer of the agent and optimal low level motion planning.
\vspace{-3 mm}
\section{Team Organization}
\vspace{-1 mm}
\label{TeamOrg}
Implementing concrete and clear communication channels between team members was one the major challenges in this project. We used several tools to communicate between team members, share source code and task assignment. A wiki-like website \footnote{https://sites.google.com/site/edisdp12} helped us to organize tasks and share design decisions. Also we used subversion for sharing developed code. A complete and detailed track of my progress through out the course of development are available on-line\footnote{https://sites.google.com/site/edisdp12/logs/behzad-tabibian}.
\vspace{-1 mm}
\section{Perception Layer}
Perception is the way in which an agent understands the environment. In this project, robots were able to percept the environment using the overhead camera. Using the images provided by the camera we were able to calculate locations and orientations(hereafter called pos) of robot and opponent, ball location on the pitch and the pitch itself.
\subsection{Initial approach}
Finding locations of different objects proved to be an easy task by using simple methods like color segmentation and available algorithms in OpenCV. However, the main challenge was in calculating robot orientation. First, I tried to use the dark spot and the \textbf{T} on the plate. This method was not very successful since isolating two objects with sufficient accuracy to calculate accurate orientation was not an easy task.
\subsection{Machine Learning}
At this point, I decided to test solutions based on Machine-Learning methods, I implemented different solutions using SVM and Bayse algorithms available in OpenCV. I used a range of features for training a model for each object. Some of them include: set of hue moments, compactness and area. I also used distance between two objects, by using this feature I was able to first find a principal object \textbf{T} and then using the distance feature find the correct dark spot close to this object.
\subsection{Central Image Moments}
Even though I could build a reliable solution based on the idea discussed earlier, I realised that for problem of this size, there should be simpler methods available, therefore I spent more time studying methods of calculating orientation of objects and after a few attempts I implemented a method using second order of central image moments.
This method is based on calculating main inertial axes, around which the object can be rotated with minimal or maximal inertia. For detailed description of this method refer to \cite{Teague:80}. Using this method orientation of an object is computed using following equations:
\begin{align}
\label{equ:centroid}
\mu'_{20} = \mu_{20} / \mu_{00} = M_{20}/M_{00} - \bar{x}^2 \\
\mu'_{02} = \mu_{02} / \mu_{00} = M_{02}/M_{00} - \bar{y}^2 \\
\mu'_{11} = \mu_{11} / \mu_{00} = M_{11}/M_{00} - \bar{x}\bar{y} \\
\Theta = \frac{1}{2} \arctan2 \left( {2\mu'_{11}},{\mu'_{20} - \mu'_{02}} \right) \label{orientationEq}
\end{align}
One can observe that equation \ref{orientationEq} produces results from $-\pi/2$ - $\pi/2$. This method cannot compute the heading of the calculated orientation vector, to disambiguate this issue I used one of the methods developed earlier. This method uses central moments of the object and the circle fitted around the object to calculate the orientation\ref{fig:CircleMethod}. Even though the method was not robust against noise but it was effective in deciding the heading of the calculated orientation using the method discussed earlier. 
\begin{figure}[htp]

\leavevmode
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth] {CenOrien.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Calculating orientation using center of mass of object and surrounding circle, used as a helper for second order of central moments}
\label{fig:CircleMethod}
\end{figure} 
\subsection{Results and Lessons learned}
We used this method during later tests, milestones and matches. Successful implementation of the solution was one of the keys to our success in milestone 3(score 70) and first friendly match(becoming semi-finalist).

Our initial implementations had a very poor performance of about 5 frames per second, however by the end of the project and using simpler methods we reached frame rates of over 22fps. Our program however suffered from major drops in frame rates on some specific machines in the lab, we could not successfully resolve the issue as the problem was not easily reproducible. This issue was one the major reasons we could not perform very well in the final match.

A few other achievements in this part of the project was to learn how to use OpenCV library effectively in C and having the chance to learn about Bayes and SVM classifiers and compare their performance in an actual project.

This part of the code-base is completely documented and open-sourced \footnote{https://sites.google.com/site/btabibian/projects/sdp}. Open-sourced library contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item Various methods of object isolation methods such as background subtraction and color segmentation.
\item Various methods of calculating orientation as described earlier.
\item Complete implementation of Machine Learning methods for object recognition.
\item Utility Functions for tuning the color segmentation thresholds.
\item Utility methods for changing functionality of program based on input parameters.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-3 mm}
\section{Motion Layer}
\vspace{-1 mm}
I also contributed to motion planning layer of the agent. Soon after I started working on vision stack I realised that to have a robust performance for robot we need a robust low level motion planning algorithm. This layer should be able to deal effectively with the noise incurred by the vision stack. The simple goal for this part is to make robot capable of following a path to reach a destination position determined by higher levels of path planning stack.
\subsection{Potential Field}
I started with implementing basic idea of Potential Fields\cite{paper:PF} algorithm. This algorithm is a well-known algorithm for robot path planning. It has several important properties which makes it suitable for our application.The main advantage of this method is that it is completely reactive and therefore if it is fed with noisy input in one cycle it will be able to recover in next cycles and therefore performance of the algorithm degrades as amount of noise increases without complete failure.
\subsection{Abstract Simulation}
I haven't had access to a complete simulation environment of the arena or the actual robot with reliable input data to work with when started working on this algorithm. Therefore I implemented a simple forward kinematic of a non-holonimic differential drive robot(basic kinematic model of our robot) in Matlab and used it to test my implementation. With some changes this basic simulation was later used for development of a complete simulation environment.
\subsection{Challenges}
During implementation of this method I had several challenges. We started testing this algorithm in milestone two and it failed. The initial intuition for most of the members was that the failure was due to complexity of the algorithm however, later we realized that the failure was due to unreliable input data from vision stack. Later team decided to abandon this idea and work on a simpler ideas. I continued working on this algorithm and also implemented extended potential field\cite{paper:OKhatib}. Once, vision stack become robust enough to provide reliable input I started testing the algorithm again. In the second attempt we observed a very good performance of the algorithm which become a key to our success in third and forth friendly matches.
\subsection{Kinematic Model and Implementation}
Part of successful implementation of potential field algorithm was to apply calculated velocity vector on the robot. To do so I used the model described earlier to decompose the velocity vector into linear and angular velocities. The calculation is based on following equations and figure \ref{fig:KinModel}:
\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth] {KinModel.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Kinematic Model of Non-holonomic Differential Drive Robot}
\label{fig:KinModel}
\end{figure}

\begin{align}
V & =k_{att}.(Pos_{current}-Pos_{destination})\\
V_{linear} &= \begin{Vmatrix}v\end{Vmatrix} cos(\theta) ,
V_{angular} = {1 \over \begin{Vmatrix}v\end{Vmatrix}} \theta
\end{align}
Integrating all this I was able to implement a successful motion planning algorithm which made our team distinguished from conventional methods of controlling robot in this project.
\subsection{Results and Lessons Learned}
An example result of running this algorithm on the robot is demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:seq}, In overall this algorithm could deal with many scenarios successfully and integrated with high level decision making layer we could obtain reliable game plays.

Developed algorithm was not completely used specifically the ability to avoid obstacles was completely abandoned because obstacle avoidance was dealt with by higher levels of decision making.Therefore the algorithm at this level is a conventional P controller. 
Users of this implementation can also utilize its capabilities in obstacle avoidance by following the documentation.
A few important lessons were learned during implementation of this algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is possible to implement reliable applications based on ideas developed in research labs.
\item Failure of an algorithm at higher levels sometimes may be due to invalid inputs from lower layers.
\item Simulation at abstract level is very useful for making sure that an algorithm is developed according to specification but successful performance on the robot is heavily affected by limitations of robot physics and the noise in real environment.

Source code of this part of the code base with its documentation is available on-line.\footnote{https://sites.google.com/site/btabibian/projects/sdp}

% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.

% conference papers do not normally have an appendix


% use section* for acknowledgement




% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later
%\IEEEtriggeratref{8}
% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}
