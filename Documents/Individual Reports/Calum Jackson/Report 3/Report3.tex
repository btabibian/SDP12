This report will document the changes made to the robot since milestone 2, and additions to the code to calculate distances and angles for a backup movement strategy due to the unrelieability of the Potential Fields method. 

Issues involving straight line ability and structure strength were dealt with by reconstructing the robot to locate the wheels at the rear of the robot, and making the structure generally more secure in the process. The kicker motor was repositioned, making the kicker longer, which will allow it to create more momentum to kick the ball. A touch sensors has been added at each side at the front of the robot, to provide feedback if the robot crashes into a wall or another robot.
