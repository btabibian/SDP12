This report, the third in the series,  will document the changes made to the robot since milestone 2. Milestone 2 was not a success, as the robot failed to move to the ball on the pitch properly. The main issue was that the method being used to move the robot, the potential fields algorithm, was very difficult to implement and was not working properly. The main goal for this milestone was to produce a strategy which could move could move to the ball, as well as avoiding obstacles, and score a goal, alongside making the suggested improvements from Individual Report 2 to the robot.//

Jouzas and I created the base for the new strategy, creating a class 

Issues involving straight line ability and structure strength were dealt with by reconstructing the robot to locate the wheels at the rear of the robot, and making the structure generally more secure in the process. The kicker motor was repositioned, making the kicker longer, which will allow it to create more momentum to kick the ball. A touch sensor has been added at each side at the front of the robot, to provide feedback if the robot crashes into a wall or another robot.
